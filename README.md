This is our Lab 2 project, created by Tristin Young and James Eyler. The listed files are our Lab 2 Python notebook, and the two CSV files used in our calculation. If you would prefer to not upload the python ntoebook yourself, it can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xP1SDv8ZTOGHlYWpoXkZKKtoepT-9enc?usp=sharing .
If for any reason the files are not uploaded or the cells are not executed, you can copy the notebook, upload the data provided in this repo, and execute all cells with no errors. This would all be unneccessary, however the submission type is PDF only, so this seemed to be the clearest way to submit our Python notebook.
